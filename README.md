### Adecco HR Analytics

Adecco India, a mid-sized technology firm, has recently experienced increasing employee attrition, particularly among junior-level employees in the sales department. The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive HR analytics study to identify the key factors contributing to employee turnover and to generate data-driven insights that support effective retention strategies.Using employee-level data encompassing demographic characteristics, job-related attributes, compensation details, and satisfaction metrics, the project applies basic and intermediate analytical techniques using Excel. Core analyses include calculating the overall attrition rate, identifying departments with the highest turnover, assessing satisfaction levels across roles, and examining demographic and compensation patterns among employees who have left the organization.The study further explores intermediate-level insights by analyzing factors correlated with attrition, including job involvement, marital status, stock options, training opportunities, and business travel frequency. Relationships between job satisfaction, performance ratings, work-life balance, employee tenure, and overtime patterns are also evaluated to understand their impact on retention.Through the use of PivotTables, scatter plots, correlation analysis, and calculated fields, the findings reveal critical attrition drivers such as low job involvement, limited career growth opportunities, frequent business travel, low satisfaction levels, and excessive overtime. These insights help identify department-specific challenges and employee segments at higher risk of leaving.Overall, this HR analytics project equips Adecco India with actionable insights to develop targeted retention strategies, enhance employee engagement, optimize career development initiatives, strengthen compensation and benefits policies, and ultimately reduce employee turnover. By leveraging data-driven decision-making, the organization can build a more stable, motivated, and high-performing workforce.
