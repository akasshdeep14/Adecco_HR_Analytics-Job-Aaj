### Adecco HR Analytics

As the analyst for this project, I transformed raw dataset information into interactive visual dashboards to uncover key trends and performance metrics. Below is a summary of the work I performed and the tools I utilized:

## What I Did

Market Segmentation Analysis: I categorized apps by their monetization strategy, identifying that a vast majority (approximately 92.61%) are free, while 7.38% are paid.

User Engagement Mapping: I visualized the total number of installs across various categories, highlighting "Game" and "Communication" as the leading sectors with over 30 billion installs each.

Performance Benchmarking: I calculated a global average rating of 3.62 across 33 categories and identified top-performing apps like ROBLOX and Duolingo.

Temporal Trend Tracking: I analyzed the App Update Trend over time, which showed a significant peak in development and maintenance activity around 2018.

Audience Targeting: I segmented the apps by content rating, finding that the "Everyone" category is the primary target audience with over 8.7k apps.

## Tools I Used

Tableau: I used Tableau to build the primary analytical dashboard, leveraging its strength in creating treemaps for category distribution and line charts for temporal trends.

Power BI: I utilized Power BI for interactive reporting, specifically for its slicers and donut charts that allow for easy filtering by content rating and price type.
This HR analytics project on Adecco India's employee attrition effectively uses Excel-based techniques to uncover actionable retention strategies. It mirrors standard practices in real-world case studies where firms like Credit Suisse and Experian reduced turnover through targeted data insights.

Data Processing Steps - 

The analysis leverages employee data on demographics, compensation, satisfaction, and job attributes, applying PivotTables for aggregation, data cleaning for outliers/duplicates, and calculated fields for metrics like attrition rate by department or role. Scatter plots and correlations reveal patterns in tenure, travel, and overtime.

Key Attrition Drivers - 

Sales department juniors show highest turnover, linked to low job involvement, limited stock options/training, high business travel, and poor work-life balance. Single employees and those with low satisfaction/performance ratings are at elevated risk.

Analytical Techniques - 

Basic metrics calculate overall attrition (e.g., 15-20% typical in mid-sized firms), department rankings, and satisfaction by role. Intermediate analysis uses correlation matrices to link marital status, overtime, and career growth to exits, with visuals highlighting risky segments.

Business Recommendations - 

Target sales with engagement programs, reduce travel via remote options, enhance training/career paths for juniors, and tie compensation to satisfaction scores. Monitor high-risk groups quarterly to cut turnover by 20-30%, boosting stability.

Ethical Guidelines - 

Ensure data anonymization, avoid bias in demographic correlations, and validate insights with HR experts for fair retention policies
