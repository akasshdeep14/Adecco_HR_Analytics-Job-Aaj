### Adecco HR Analytics

This HR analytics project on Adecco India's employee attrition effectively uses Excel-based techniques to uncover actionable retention strategies. It mirrors standard practices in real-world case studies where firms like Credit Suisse and Experian reduced turnover through targeted data insights.
​

Data Processing Steps - 

The analysis leverages employee data on demographics, compensation, satisfaction, and job attributes, applying PivotTables for aggregation, data cleaning for outliers/duplicates, and calculated fields for metrics like attrition rate by department or role. Scatter plots and correlations reveal patterns in tenure, travel, and overtime.

Key Attrition Drivers - 

Sales department juniors show highest turnover, linked to low job involvement, limited stock options/training, high business travel, and poor work-life balance. Single employees and those with low satisfaction/performance ratings are at elevated risk.

Analytical Techniques - 

Basic metrics calculate overall attrition (e.g., 15-20% typical in mid-sized firms), department rankings, and satisfaction by role. Intermediate analysis uses correlation matrices to link marital status, overtime, and career growth to exits, with visuals highlighting risky segments.

Business Recommendations - 

Target sales with engagement programs, reduce travel via remote options, enhance training/career paths for juniors, and tie compensation to satisfaction scores. Monitor high-risk groups quarterly to cut turnover by 20-30%, boosting stability.

Ethical Guidelines - 

Ensure data anonymization, avoid bias in demographic correlations, and validate insights with HR experts for fair retention policies
